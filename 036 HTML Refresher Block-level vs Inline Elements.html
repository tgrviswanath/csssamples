<p>You can read a more detailed article (which also includes a YouTube video about HTML at the top of the page) here: <a href="https://academind.com/learn/html/beginner-s-guide/diving-deeper-into-html#block-level-vs-inline-elements" rel="nofollow">https://academind.com/learn/html/beginner-s-guide/diving-deeper-into-html#block-level-vs-inline-elements</a></p>



































<p><em>Here's the executive summary:</em></p>



































<p><strong>Block-level elements</strong> are rendered as a block and hence take up all the available horizontal space. You can set margin-top and margin-bottom and two block-level elements will render in two different lines.</p>



































<p>Some examples are: <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> , <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> , <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> , <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>  but also <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> , <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>  etc and <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> .</p>



































<p><strong>Inline elements </strong>on the other hand only take up the space they require to fit their content in. Hence two inline-elements will fit into the same line (as long as the combined content doesn't take up the entire space in which case a line break would be added).</p>





















<p>They also use the box-model you learned about but <code>margin-top</code>  and <code>margin-bottom</code>  have no effect on the element. <code>padding-top</code>  and <code>padding-bottom</code>  also have a different effect. They don't push the adjacent content away but they will do so with the element border. You can read more about that behavior in the following article: <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/03/understanding-inline-box-model/" rel="nofollow">https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/03/understanding-inline-box-model/</a></p>



<p>Additionally, setting a <code>width</code>  or <code>height</code>  on an inline element also has no effect. The width and height is auto to take as much space as required by the content.</p>





















<p>Logically, this makes sense since you don't want your inline elements to destroy your multi-line text-layout. If you want to do so or need both block-level and inline behavior, you can set <code>display: inline-block</code>  to merge behaviors.</p>











<p>Some example elements are: <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> , <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> , <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> </p></p>
